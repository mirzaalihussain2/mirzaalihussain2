- 👋 Hi, I’m @mirzaalihussain2 but I go by Ali
- I love Product, especially the 0-to-1 phase, and spent 3 years as a Product Manager for a London-based tech startup.
- I'm now getting closer to the building part of products.

TECHY STUFF
- 👀 I’m interested in universal APIs (think: TrueLayer, Duffel, Impala, Terra, Curacel), blockchain & crypto, new graph tech, solving customer problems.
- I've got some experience using Python for data analysis (including using numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries) in a commercial setting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where (1) there's a real customer problem AND (2) my skills will be helpful (PM, data analysis or front-end skills).
- 📫 Hit me up via GitHub.

NON-TECHY STUFF
- Currently travelling around South East Asia, with a mix of learning & travelling.
- I like cycling, running & all things outdoorsy.
- I'm a big reader: I like classic American fiction (F. Scott Fitzgerald, Patricia Highsmith, John Updike) and business leadership books.
- Currently reading 'Things Fall Apart' by Chinua Achebe (again!) and 'The Hard Thing about Hard Things' by Ben Horowitz.
